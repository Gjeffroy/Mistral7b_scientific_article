# Mistral 7b Scientific Vulgarisator

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook developed on Google Colab for developing a scientific vulgarisator based on Mistral 7b. The implementation uses LangChain and Transformer models to generate simplified and accessible summaries of complex scientific articles.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a scientific vulgarisator that can take complex scientific articles as input and generate simplified summaries suitable for a broader audience. Mistral 7b, implemented with LangChain and Transformer, are utilized for this purpose. Different prompts are experimented with to achieve a consistent and accessible summary of complex scientific articles.

## Contents

- `Mistral_7b_pipeline.ipynb`: This notebook contains the implementation of the scientific vulgarisator using Mistral 7b, LangChain, and Transformer models. It explores various prompts and techniques to generate simplified summaries of scientific articles.

## Getting Started

To run this notebook, you can either clone this repository and run it locally in your Jupyter environment or open it directly in Google Colab.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- LangChain
- Transformer models (such as Hugging Face's Transformers library)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mistral-scientific-vulgarisator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```
    cd mistral-scientific-vulgarisator
    ```

3. Open the notebook `Mistral_7b_pipeline.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment or Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially.

## Results

By the end of the notebook, you should gain insights into how Mistral 7b, LangChain, and Transformer models can be used to develop a scientific vulgarisator that simplifies complex scientific articles for a broader audience.
